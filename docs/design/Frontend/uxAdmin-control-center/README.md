# uxAdmin Control Center Proposal

This workspace collects a concept for the VirtualBank administrator "command center". It outlines
experience goals, navigation patterns, modular surfaces, and the operational telemetry required to
keep the fictional economy healthy. Use these notes alongside the existing `uxAdmin.html` prototype
when evolving the production-ready admin console.

## Folder Contents
- `design_document.md` – Deep-dive into the experience architecture, feature pillars, and UX
  patterns that shape the command center.
- `feature_catalog.md` – Breakdown of functional modules, intended operators, priority, and key
  success metrics.
- `journey_map.md` – Role-based storyboard describing how administrators navigate common
  maintenance and incident workflows.

Feel free to extend this area with wireframes, component inventories, or motion studies as the
concept matures.
