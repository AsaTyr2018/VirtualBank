# VirtualBank Design Blueprint

## 1. Vision & Experience Goals
- Deliver a "Best UX Ever" feeling through responsive interactions, intuitive flows, and delightful microcopy.
- Emphasize that VirtualBank uses a playful, fictional currency while still modeling authentic banking behaviors.
- Maintain modularity across the stack to support rapid iteration and feature expansion.
- Support a thriving multi-user economy where every participant has a personalized account space while administrators (Game Masters) can orchestrate events, tune economic levers, and safeguard the experience.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Client (Frontend)**: React-based single-page application that consumes RESTful APIs and real-time event streams.
- **Middleware**: Node.js service acting as an API gateway and orchestrator, responsible for request validation, caching, and security enforcement.
- **Backend Services**: Microservice suite implemented with TypeScript (NestJS) and PostgreSQL for persistent storage, accompanied by a Redis instance for ephemeral data.
- **Market Simulation Context**: Independent stock-market sandbox exposed through APIs and event streams, operating alongside the middleware while respecting shared observability and identity standards.
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, with CI/CD pipelines enforcing quality gates and automated testing.

- Attribute-based access control enriches role policies with account ownership metadata, allowing safe delegation (e.g., guardians managing youth accounts).

## 5. Backend Design
### 5.1 Service Composition
- **User & Identity Service**: Registers players, Game Masters, and optional observers; manages authentication artifacts and role claims.
- **Account Service**: Manages virtual accounts, balances, and account metadata, including joint or custodial setups.
- **Transaction Service**: Handles transfers, batch operations, and ledger entries.
- **Credit Service**: Issues credit lines, tracks utilization, schedules repayments, and enforces Game Master-defined policies.
- **Yield & Income Service**: Simulates savings products, distributes interest accruals, and orchestrates passive income mechanics (e.g., virtual staking pools, quests).
- **Rewards Service**: Tracks gamified achievements and fun-currency rewards.
- **Notification Service**: Sends real-time updates via email, push, or in-app alerts.
- **Market Gateway**: Bridges the middleware with the market simulation context, translating authenticated player intents into market-safe commands and streaming market data back to clients.

### 5.2 Data Modeling
- PostgreSQL schemas with strict referential integrity and JSONB columns for extensible metadata.
- Multi-tenant partitioning strategies keyed by user and optional guild/house affiliation to isolate player economies.
- Event sourcing for transaction events, allowing auditing and replay capabilities.
- Credit ledgers include amortization schedules and configurable interest models (fixed, floating, promotional).
- Yield products store rate formulas, compounding cadences, and eligibility constraints set by Game Masters.
- Redis streams for queuing asynchronous tasks and facilitating pub/sub patterns.

### 5.3 APIs & Integrations
- REST endpoints following JSON:API conventions with pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- GraphQL gateway (optional) for complex dashboard queries.
- Webhooks to trigger automation scenarios (e.g., achievements unlocked).
- Integration tests run via Jest and Pact for contract validation.

### 5.4 Market Simulation Bounded Context
The market simulation operates as a modular suite of services that can evolve independently while integrating through clear APIs.

- **Market-Data Service**
  - Generates synthetic ticks and bars with organic behaviors (trend phases, volatility clusters, and stochastic jump events).
  - Maintains sector-based indices (Tech, Energy, Meme, Industrials, BankSim) and a headline composite index driven by beta-weighted components.
  - Emits generated corporate news with sentiment tags (ðŸŸ¢ bullish, ðŸ”´ bearish) and estimated impact to drive regime shifts.
  - Hosts a regime scheduler that cycles through Calm, Trend Up/Down, High Volatility, and Crash/Boom states with configurable dwell times and decay curves.

- **Matching Engine**
  - Supports market, limit, and stop orders with price-time priority, plus opening/closing call auctions.
  - Implements an order book with Level-2 depth snapshots, trades tape streaming, and circuit breakers that trigger halts on extreme moves.
  - Applies maker/taker fees and simulates slippage during high-volatility intervals to keep the experience fair yet exciting.

- **Portfolio Service**
  - Tracks holdings per user with FIFO/LIFO lot metadata, unrealized and realized P&L, and dividend accrual events tied to company schedules.
  - Maintains tax-disclaimer messaging reminding players that the fun currency is outside real-world regulation.
  - Provides portfolio analytics for dashboards, including exposure by sector and risk-adjusted fun metrics.

- **Risk & Surveillance Service**
  - Monitors positional limits, volatility exposure, and leverage across users.
  - Detects suspicious patterns (wash trading, self-trading, spoofing) and can enforce cooldowns or auto-cancel orders.
  - Coordinates with the matching engine to issue circuit-breaker banners and communicate halts via system notices.

- **Leaderboard & Analytics Service**
  - Calculates realized gains, rolling Sharpe-like fun ratios, and seasonal event standings.
  - Powers watchlists, heatmaps, depth charts, and circuit-breaker alerts for the Market Desk UI.
  - Archives historical bars for charting and simulation replays.

### 5.5 Market Simulation Data & Integration
- **Data Stores**: Timeseries database (TimescaleDB extension on PostgreSQL) for tick/bar storage, Redis for real-time order books, and object storage for replay bundles.
- **API Contracts**: REST and WebSocket endpoints for market data, order routing, and portfolio insights. Middleware signs requests using user identity claims and relays event streams via topic-based channels.
- **Correlation Modeling**: Sector covariance matrices drive correlated noise injected into ticker generation. Index drift factors apply beta-weighted adjustments to constituent prices.
- **Event Engine**: Crash/boom injections apply jump-diffusion adjustments with exponential decay, while dividend days and earnings simulations trigger news, pricing gaps, and trade halts.
- **Fair-Play Controls**: Rate limits per user, per-instrument position caps, and configurable cooldowns post-halt prevent exploitative behavior.

## 6. Security & Compliance
- Role-Based Access Control with scoped permissions (admin, auditor, customer).
- Data encryption at rest (PostgreSQL TDE) and in transit (TLS everywhere).
- Static code analysis and dependency scanning in CI/CD.
- Audit trails for administrative actions, accessible via dedicated tooling.
- Clear disclaimers that all currency is fictional to avoid regulatory ambiguity.
- Dual-approval workflows for high-impact Game Master actions (e.g., mass credit forgiveness, rate adjustments) to deter misuse.

## 7. Observability & Operations
- Centralized logging (ELK stack) and metrics (Prometheus + Grafana dashboards).
- Synthetic monitoring to emulate user journeys and track UX health KPIs.
- Automated chaos testing in non-production environments to ensure resilience.

## 8. UX Best Practices Checklist
- Keep primary CTAs above the fold with high contrast.
- Provide celebratory animations when users complete tasks.
- Offer contextual tips explaining fake currency mechanics.
- Ensure loading states, skeleton screens, and error recovery flows are polished.

## 9. Roadmap Considerations
- Gamified leaderboards comparing friendly virtual wealth.
- API marketplace for community-built fun currency extensions.
- AI-driven financial coaching for playful budget recommendations.
- Seasonal economy events (e.g., yield boosts, credit holidays) curated by Game Masters to keep the virtual world vibrant.

## 10. Virtual Economy Mechanics
- **Credits & Loans**: Players request credit lines based on reputation scores, collateral tokens, or Game Master missions. Repayments can be manual or auto-deducted from income streams.
- **Interest & Yield**: Savings vaults and investment minigames apply configurable compounding rules. Game Masters can publish promotional rates or penalty tiers for late repayments.
- **Income Generation**: Players earn through quests, marketplace gigs, referral bonuses, staking pools, and collaborative ventures. Automation rules allow steady passive income drops while keeping total supply in check.
- **Game Master Controls**: Central dashboards to set macroeconomic levers (base interest rate, credit risk multipliers, event-based multipliers) and to simulate stress scenarios.
- **Economy Health Monitoring**: KPIs such as total circulating currency, credit default ratios, yield payout velocity, and per-user wealth distribution feed into dashboards for proactive balancing.
- **Virtual Stock Market**: Fictional companies grouped by sector issue shares whose prices respond to regime schedules, news impacts, and user trading activity. Game Masters can trigger special events (earnings sims, dividend days, meme rallies) to influence liquidity and volatility.

## 11. Summary
VirtualBank's design blends modern architecture with a whimsical yet secure user experience. By separating concerns across the frontend, middleware, and backend, the platform remains modular, scalable, and delightful for users exploring virtual finance.
